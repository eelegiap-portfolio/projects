            The Communist Manifesto is divided into a preamble and four sections, the last of these a short conclusion.
            The
            introduction begins: "A spectre is haunting Europe—the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe
            have
            entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre." Pointing out that parties everywhere—including those
            in
            government and those in the opposition—have flung the "branding reproach of communism" at each other, the
            authors infer from this that the powers-that-be acknowledge communism to be a power in itself. Subsequently,
            the
            introduction exhorts Communists to openly publish their views and aims, to "meet this nursery tale of the
            spectre of communism with a manifesto of the party itself".

            The first section of the Manifesto, "Bourgeois and Proletarians", elucidates the materialist conception of
            history, that "the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles". Societies
            have
            always taken the form of an oppressed majority exploited under the yoke of an oppressive minority. In
            capitalism, the industrial working class, or proletariat, engage in class struggle against the owners of the
            means of production, the bourgeoisie. As before, this struggle will end in a revolution that restructures
            society, or the "common ruin of the contending classes". The bourgeoisie, through the "constant
            revolutionising
            of production [and] uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions" have emerged as the supreme class in
            society, displacing all the old powers of feudalism. The bourgeoisie constantly exploits the proletariat for
            its
            labour power, creating profit for themselves and accumulating capital. However, in doing so the bourgeoisie
            serves as "its own grave-diggers"; the proletariat inevitably will become conscious of their own potential
            and
            rise to power through revolution, overthrowing the bourgeoisie.

            "Proletarians and Communists", the second section, starts by stating the relationship of conscious
            communists to
            the rest of the working class. The communists' party will not oppose other working-class parties, but unlike
            them, it will express the general will and defend the common interests of the world's proletariat as a
            whole,
            independent of all nationalities. The section goes on to defend communism from various objections, including
            claims that it advocates communal prostitution or disincentivises people from working. The section ends by
            outlining a set of short-term demands—among them a progressive income tax; abolition of inheritances and
            private
            property; abolition of child labour; free public education; nationalisation of the means of transport and
            communication; centralisation of credit via a national bank; expansion of publicly owned land, etc.—the
            implementation of which would result in the precursor to a stateless and classless society.

            The third section, "Socialist and Communist Literature", distinguishes communism from other socialist
            doctrines
            prevalent at the time—these being broadly categorised as Reactionary Socialism; Conservative or Bourgeois
            Socialism; and Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism. While the degree of reproach toward rival
            perspectives
            varies, all are dismissed for advocating reformism and failing to recognise the pre-eminent revolutionary
            role
            of the working class.

            "Position of the Communists in Relation to the Various Opposition Parties", the concluding section of the
            Manifesto, briefly discusses the communist position on struggles in specific countries in the mid-nineteenth
            century such as France, Switzerland, Poland and Germany, this last being "on the eve of a bourgeois
            revolution"
            and predicts that a world revolution will soon follow. It ends by declaring an alliance with the democratic
            socialists, boldly supporting other communist revolutions and calling for united international proletarian
            action—"Working Men of All Countries, Unite!".
            In spring 1847, Marx and Engels joined the League of the Just, who were quickly convinced by the duo's ideas
            of
            "critical communism". At its First Congress in 2–9 June, the League tasked Engels with drafting a
            "profession of
            faith", but such a document was later deemed inappropriate for an open, non-confrontational organisation.
            Engels
            nevertheless wrote the "Draft of a Communist Confession of Faith", detailing the League's programme. A few
            months later, in October, Engels arrived at the League's Paris branch to find that Moses Hess had written an
            inadequate manifesto for the group, now called the League of Communists. In Hess's absence, Engels severely
            criticised this manifesto, and convinced the rest of the League to entrust him with drafting a new one. This
            became the draft Principles of Communism, described as "less of a credo and more of an exam paper".

            On 23 November, just before the Communist League's Second Congress (29 November – 8 December 1847), Engels
            wrote
            to Marx, expressing his desire to eschew the catechism format in favour of the manifesto, because he felt it
            "must contain some history." On the 28th, Marx and Engels met at Ostend in Belgium, and a few days later,
            gathered at the Soho, London headquarters of the German Workers' Education Association to attend the
            Congress.
            Over the next ten days, intense debate raged between League functionaries; Marx eventually dominated the
            others
            and, overcoming "stiff and prolonged opposition",[4] in Harold Laski's words, secured a majority for his
            programme. The League thus unanimously adopted a far more combative resolution than that at the First
            Congress
            in June. Marx (especially) and Engels were subsequently commissioned to draw up a manifesto for the League.

            Upon returning to Brussels, Marx engaged in "ceaseless procrastination", according to his biographer Francis
            Wheen. Working only intermittently on the Manifesto, he spent much of his time delivering lectures on
            political
            economy at the German Workers' Education Association, writing articles for the Deutsche-Brüsseler-Zeitung,
            and
            giving a long speech on free trade. Following this, he even spent a week (17–26 January 1848) in Ghent to
            establish a branch of the Democratic Association there. Subsequently, having not heard from Marx for nearly
            two
            months, the Central Committee of the Communist League sent him an ultimatum on 24 or 26 January, demanding
            he
            submit the completed manuscript by 1 February. This imposition spurred Marx on, who struggled to work
            without a
            deadline, and he seems to have rushed to finish the job in time. For evidence of this, historian Eric
            Hobsbawm
            points to the absence of rough drafts, only one page of which survives.

            In all, the Manifesto was written over 6–7 weeks. Although Engels is credited as co-writer, the final draft
            was
            penned exclusively by Marx. From the 26 January letter, Laski infers that even the Communist League
            considered
            Marx to be the sole draftsman and that he was merely their agent, imminently replaceable. Further, Engels
            himself wrote in 1883: "The basic thought running through the Manifesto [...] belongs solely and exclusively
            to
            Marx". Although Laski does not disagree, he suggests that Engels underplays his own contribution with
            characteristic modesty and points out the "close resemblance between its substance and that of the
            [Principles
            of Communism]". Laski argues that while writing the Manifesto, Marx drew from the "joint stock of ideas" he
            developed with Engels "a kind of intellectual bank account upon which either could draw freely".

            A number of late-20th- and 21st-century writers have commented on the Communist Manifesto's continuing
            relevance. In a special issue of the Socialist Register commemorating the Manifesto's 150th anniversary,
            Peter
            Osborne argued that it was "the single most influential text written in the nineteenth century".[10]
            Academic
            John Raines in 2002 noted: "In our day this Capitalist Revolution has reached the farthest corners of the
            earth.
            The tool of money has produced the miracle of the new global market and the ubiquitous shopping mall. Read
            The
            Communist Manifesto, written more than one hundred and fifty years ago, and you will discover that Marx
            foresaw
            it all".[11] In 2003, English Marxist Chris Harman stated: "There is still a compulsive quality to its prose
            as
            it provides insight after insight into the society in which we live, where it comes from and where it's
            going
            to. It is still able to explain, as mainstream economists and sociologists cannot, today's world of
            recurrent
            wars and repeated economic crisis, of hunger for hundreds of millions on the one hand and 'overproduction'
            on
            the other. There are passages that could have come from the most recent writings on globalisation".[12] Alex
            Callinicos, editor of International Socialism, stated in 2010: "This is indeed a manifesto for the 21st
            century".[13] Writing in The London Evening Standard , Andrew Neather cited Verso Books' 2012 re-edition of
            The
            Communist Manifesto with an introduction by Eric Hobsbawm as part of a resurgence of left-wing-themed ideas
            which includes the publication of Owen Jones' best-selling Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class and
            Jason Barker's documentary Marx Reloaded.[14]

            In contrast, critics such as revisionist Marxist and reformist socialist Eduard Bernstein distinguished
            between
            "immature" early Marxism—as exemplified by The Communist Manifesto written by Marx and Engels in their
            youth—that he opposed for its violent Blanquist tendencies and later "mature" Marxism that he supported.[15]
            This latter form refers to Marx in his later life acknowledging that socialism could be achieved through
            peaceful means through legislative reform in democratic societies.[16] Bernstein declared that the massive
            and
            homogeneous working-class claimed in the Communist Manifesto did not exist, and that contrary to claims of a
            proletarian majority emerging, the middle-class was growing under capitalism and not disappearing as Marx
            had
            claimed. Bernstein noted that the working-class was not homogeneous but heterogeneous, with divisions and
            factions within it, including socialist and non-socialist trade unions. Marx himself, later in his life,
            acknowledged that the middle-class was not disappearing in his work Theories of Surplus Value (1863). The
            obscurity of the later work means that Marx's acknowledgement of this error is not well known.[17] George
            Boyer
            described the Manifesto as "very much a period piece, a document of what was called the 'hungry' 1840s".[18]

            Many have drawn attention to the passage in the Manifesto that seems to sneer at the stupidity of the
            rustic:
            "The bourgeoisie [...] draws all nations [...] into civilisation[.] [...] It has created enormous cities
            [...]
            and thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy [sic] of rural life".[19] However, as
            Eric Hobsbawm noted:
            [W]hile there is no doubt that Marx at this time shared the usual townsman's contempt for, as well as
            ignorance
            of, the peasant milieu, the actual and analytically more interesting German phrase ("dem Idiotismus des
            Landlebens entrissen") referred not to "stupidity" but to "the narrow horizons", or "the isolation from the
            wider society" in which people in the countryside lived. It echoed the original meaning of the Greek term
            idiotes from which the current meaning of "idiot" or "idiocy" is derived, namely "a person concerned only
            with
            his own private affairs and not with those of the wider community". In the course of the decades since the
            1840s, and in movements whose members, unlike Marx, were not classically educated, the original sense was
            lost
            and was misread
